## Short version

Leo Lahti is associate professor in Data Science in University of Turku, Finland. The research team focuses on the development of open algorithmic techniques that bridge the gap between the theory and practice of modern scientific data analysis. The applications  range from human microbiome research to computational history and open government data analytics. Lahti obtained doctoral degree (DSc) in statistical machine learning and bioinformatics from Aalto University in Finland (2010), followed by subsequent postdoctoral research  at EBI/Hinxton (UK; Alvis Brazma), Wageningen University (NL; Willem de Vos), and KU Leuven (BE; Jeroen Raes). Dr Lahti has published widely used open research software, and is the founder and first coordinator of Open Knowledge Finland Open Science work group.

## Long version

Leo Lahti is associate professor in Data Science in University of Turku, Finland. The research team focuses on the development of open algorithmic techniques that bridge the gap between the theory and practice of modern scientific data analysis. The applications  range from human microbiome research to computational history and open government data analytics. Lahti obtained doctoral degree (DSc) in statistical machine learning and bioinformatics from Aalto University in Finland (2010), developing probabilistic methods for multi-omics data integration in human functional genomics. This was followed by subsequent postdoctoral research at EBI/Hinxton (UK; Alvis Brazma), Wageningen University (NL; Willem de Vos), and KU Leuven (BE; Jeroen Raes). Lahti has coordinated several international networks in data science methods and applications, including e.g. the COST action on statistical and machine learning methods in microbiome studies, and organizes international training events on a regular basis. He is a founder of the open science work group of Open Knowledge Finland ry. For more information, see: http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti
