## Long version

Leo Lahti is associate professor in Data Science in University of Turku, Finland. His research team focuses on algorithmic techniques that bridge the gap between the theory and practice of modern scientific data analysis. The applications  range from human microbiome research to computational history and open government data analytics. Lahti obtained doctoral degree (DSc) in statistical machine learning and bioinformatics from Aalto University in Finland (2010), developing probabilistic data integration methods in life science applications. This was followed by subsequent postdoctoral research at EBI/Hinxton (UK; Alvis Brazma), Wageningen University (NL; Willem de Vos), and KU Leuven (BE; Jeroen Raes). Lahti has coordinated international networks in data science methods and applications, including e.g. the COST action on statistical and machine learning methods in microbiome studies, and organizes international training events on a regular basis. He is a founder of the open science work group of Open Knowledge Finland ry. For more information, see the research homepage [iki.fi/Leo.Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti)
