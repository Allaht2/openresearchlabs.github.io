## Long version

Leo Lahti is professor in Data Science in University of Turku, Finland. His team focuses on computational analysis of complex natural and social systems. Lahti obtained doctoral degree (DSc) in probabilistic machine learning at the Aalto University in Finland (2010), developing data integration methods in life sciences. This was followed by postdoctoral research at EBI/Hinxton (UK), Wageningen University (NL), and VIB/KU Leuven (BE). Lahti has coordinated international networks in data science methods and applications and organizes international training events on a regular basis. He is the national delegate in the Committee on Data of the International Science Council and a founder of the open science work group of Open Knowledge Finland ry.
