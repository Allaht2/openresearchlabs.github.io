## Long version

Leo Lahti is associate professor in Data Science in University of Turku, Finland. His team focuses on computational analysis of complex natural and social systems and the development of related open data science frameworks. The key application areas include microbial metagenomics and computational humanities. Lahti obtained doctoral degree (DSc) in statistical machine learning and bioinformatics from Aalto University in Finland (2010), developing probabilistic data integration methods in life sciences. This was followed by postdoctoral research periods at EBI/Hinxton (UK; Alvis Brazma), Wageningen University (NL; Willem de Vos), and KU Leuven (BE; Jeroen Raes). Lahti has coordinated international networks in data science methods and applications, including e.g. the COST action on statistical and machine learning methods in microbiome studies, and organizes international training events on a regular basis. He is the national delegate in the Committee on Data of the International Science Council and a founder of the open science work group of Open Knowledge Finland ry.
