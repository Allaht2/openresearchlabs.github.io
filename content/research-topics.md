Research topics
===============

**Our research focuses on computational analysis of complex natural
and social systems.** Targeted techniques are needed to extract
information and insights from rich data streams based on combinations
of human and machine intelligence. We blend elements from machine
learning/AI, statistical and probabilistic programming, complex
systems, and data science, and coordinate open developer communities
that help to translate latest theoretical advances into accessible
methods to inform modeling, experimentation, and
decision-making. **Key applications** include microbiome research,
population studies, and computational humanities. We have coordinated
[Open Knowledge Finland Open Science work
group](https://fi.okfn.org/wg/openscience/), which received **Open
Science and Research award of the Ministry of Education and Culture in
2017**, and are active contributors in the **national FIN-CLARIAH
research infrastructure for computational humanities**.
