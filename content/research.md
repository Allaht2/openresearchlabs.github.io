# Research topics

**Our research focuses on computational analysis and understanding of
complex natural and social systems.** There is a great demand for
targeted computational techniques to extract information and insights
from rich data collections based on clever combinations of human and
machine intelligence. We blend elements from fields such as machine
learning/AI, probabilistic programming, statistical ecology, and data
science, and drive open developer communities that help to translate
latest theoretical advances into accessible methods to inform
modeling, experimentation, and decision-making. **Key applications**
include microbiome research, population cohort studies, and
computational social sciences and humanities (SSH) research. We also
coordinate the [Open Knowledge Finland Open Science work
group](https://fi.okfn.org/wg/openscience/), which received **Open
Science and Research award of the Ministry of Education and Culture in
2017**.

**Functional genomics** Mapping of the three billion base-pair human
genome sequence in 2001 was the first step towards uncovering the
dynamic and contextual functional properties of the
genome. Understanding functional organization of genetic information
and its regulation through transcriptional, epigenetic, and other
mechanisms remains a key challenge for human biology. We have done
research in cancer studies, large gene expression databases, and
multi-omics data integration.  <!--In the thesis work, I developed
open source machine learning algorithms for data integration in
functional genomics.  For more details, check the [list of
publications](/work/pubs) and the [PhD
thesis](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2010/isbn9789526033686).-->

evolution, history of knowledge production in western societies, and
open research software for social sciences and humanities (SSH)
research.

### Highlights

[rOpenGov](https://ropengov.org) developer network and

We develop theory, methods and applications of modern statistical data analysis.

We have
advocated open science, and some highlights include a [report on the
openness of academic
publishers](https://openscience.fi/-/openness-of-academic-publishers-evaluated-for-the-first-time),
commissioned by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture; [opening of
several agreements with academic publishers in
2017-2019](http://finelib.fi/finelib-agreements-published/) and
[opening of scientific journal subscription costs in Finland
2010-2017](https://fi.okfn.org/2018/08/27/finland-remains-a-leading-country-in-the-transparency-of-academic-publishing-costs)
following our FOI requests. 

We collaborate actively with applied research teams, such as
[Helsinki Computational History (COMHIS)
Group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/computational-history)
to model and analysed the history of knowledge production following
the emergence of print press in the fifteenth century.
